                    Ronit has been growing with her art since she was 5 years old begging to follow in her older brother's footsteps and attend classes at Red Wall Art Studio. It was at the same studio that she discovered her love for charcoal, a medium that never adheres to the pages, which she could manipulate until she deemed perfect not until it dried. <br>
                    A lot has changed since then, for instance where she makes her art. Currently she is based at Chamblee High School, where she discovered her love for water soluble mediums
