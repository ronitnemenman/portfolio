                  Ronit has been evolving with her art style since she was born. When she was 5 her brother began to take art classes at Red Wall Art Studio. She was to young to join him, but the spark was ignited for life time of art. When she was finally able to attend classes, she almost immediately discovered her love for charcoal and its almost infinite flexibility to work and rework till she deemed it complete.<br>
                    A lot has changed since she first stepped into that studio, she has since taken classes at Oak Grove Elementary, Chamblee Middle School, Asa's Alley, and currently Chamblee High School. She has experimented to find more media to express herself with, adn as she enters university she will to explore even more.
