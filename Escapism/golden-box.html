					Golden Box was the visual representation of Ronit Nemenman's feelings after her grandfather's death. She pushed herself into escapism until reaching a breaking point, when she couldn't stop remembering. Just as the poem itself is in black and white, the box is almost entirely inconspicuous, yet its gold coloring draws the viewer's eye, signaling its importance despite its plain shape and style.

					"A golden box and stories<br>
					Are all I have left<br>
					...<br>
					Soaked tissues in my pocket<br>
					A pocket knife you cherished<br>
					...<br>
					The stories kept me alive<br>
					I only felt smiles that barely held<br>
					Only felt tears not for me<br>
					...<br>
					I cried for you<br>
					I cried because I haven't let myself<br>
					I cried because I realized I was alone<br>
					I cried in the dark with a closed door<br>
					Protected from the world<br>
					I cried with music blasting<br>
					...<br>
					I cried for the stories I heard<br>
					In front of a golden box<br>
					And a wreath of flowers<br>
					...<br>
					That golden box into the ground<br>
					The one with your name on it<br>
					And you inside it"

			<p>After working in charcoal for about a week, the piece was ready to seal and cover in water soluble crayon to create a subtle but unmistakable gold.</p>

			    Using a ruler, Ronit Nemenman wrote as much of the poem as she could to create a blurred yet meaningful background for the piece.
